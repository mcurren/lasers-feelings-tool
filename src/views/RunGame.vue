          <p>Play to find out how they defeat the threat. Introduce the threat by showing evidence of its recent badness. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it’s about to happen, then ask them what they do.</p>
          <p><em>“Zorgon charges the megacannons on his ship. What do you do?”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Daneela pours you a glass of Arcturan whiskey and slips her arm around your waist. What do you do?”</em></p>
          <p>Call for a roll when the situation is uncertain. Don’t pre-plan outcomes—let the chips fall where they may.</p>
          <p>Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.</p>
          <p>Ask questions and build on the answers.</p>
          <p><em>“Have any of you encountered a Void Cultist before? Where? What happened?”</em></p>
